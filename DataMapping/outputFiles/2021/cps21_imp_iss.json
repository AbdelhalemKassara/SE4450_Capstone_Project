Obliger à faire quelque chose qu'on ne veux pas faire sous des menaces. La majorité des travailleurs ciblés dans ce projet de loi, ont tous continués de travailler en prenant des précautions et il n'y a pas eu d'éclosions dans ces mieux de travail.  D'autant plus que les voyageurs vont devoir etre vaccinés et montrer des tests négatifs. Alors que ça fait des mois, que nous sommes en contacts avec eux et qu'ils n'étaient pas vacciné ni n'avait besoin de montrer des tests négatifs.  Ils ouvrent les frontières mais vont faire perdre des emplois à des travailleurs qui n'ont pas lâchés durant les périodes difficiles et encore plus contagieuses car nous n'avions rien pour nous protéger. On ne pouvait même pas refuser un voyageur malade. Maintenant, on peut le faire.  Dans les fonctionnaires de bureaux, ils n'ont qu'à garder leur distance, leur masque et se laver les mains, au besoin mettre des gants. La liberté de choisir ce que l'on veut pour nous et pour nos enfants, c'est TRÈS important.  Si on préfères ne PAS aller dans les activités comme resto,quilles,cinéma, concert,spectacles, etc..   pour ne pas avoir à se faire injecter un vaccin dont on ne veut pas,  ben, on est prêt à le faire.  Ça fait tellement longtemps qu'ils nous mettre en confinement, on s'habitue. Pour nous,  c'est clair qu'un parti politique qui maintient qu'il va obliger les travailleurs (tsé ceux qui ont le coeur de travailler, de payer des impôts, des taxes,etc) à se faire vacciner et ce, sans égard à leur choix personnel.  Ils ne doivent juste plus être au pouvoir.  C'est le temps qu'ils quittent car ils sont en train de diviser les familles, les collègues de travail, la collectivité. Ils emmènent de la discrimination sur des choix personnels, sur des informations médicales confidentielles, etc.....  et ça va être encore pire si ils veulent le faire au moins de 12 ans.
